# Universal-prior sub-normalization (Paper II, §1.1)

Provenance: `02_mdl_dominance_and_discovery.md`, §1.1 (the prequential-MDL Bayesian mixture
`P̄(o_t | o_{<t}) = Σ_{R' ∈ M} w(R' | o_{<t}) P_{R'}(o_t | o_{<t})` over a countable hypothesis
class `M`, with prior `w(R') ∝ 2^{−K(R')}`). For the proportionality `∝` to define a
(sub-)probability — and hence the mixture to be well-defined — the unnormalized weights must have
finite total mass `≤ 1`. That is the Kraft–McMillan inequality.

Status: PROVED as pure code-length statements, on top of Mathlib's `kraft_mcmillan_inequality`.
This is the *arithmetic core* of §1.1's well-definedness only.

## What this DOES establish
* `uniquelyDecodable_of_subset`: a subset of a uniquely-decodable code is uniquely decodable
  (a one-line bridge absent upstream — Mathlib's `UniquelyDecodable` file has only
  `epsilon_not_mem`/`flatten_injective`).
* `prior_finset_sum_le_one`: the binary (`α = Bool`) specialization of Kraft–McMillan —
  for a finite uniquely-decodable binary code, `∑_{w ∈ S} (1/2)^{|w|} ≤ 1`.
* `prior_tsum_le_one`: the countable extension — for a hypothesis class enumerated without
  repeats by a uniquely-decodable binary code, the unnormalized weights `2^{−ℓ(R)}` sum to
  `≤ 1`, so the §1.1 prior `w(R') ∝ 2^{−K(R')}` normalizes and the Bayesian mixture is
  well-defined.

## What this does NOT establish (stays in prose; no overclaiming)
* No Kolmogorov complexity `K`: `ℓ(R) = (code R).length` is an abstract codeword length; we do
  not formalize `K(R)`, the universal reference machine `U_ref`, or `K(R) = r`.
* Not the Kraft–Chaitin bridge that shortest programs / minimal descriptions form a
  uniquely-decodable (prefix-free) set — i.e. that one may take code-lengths `= K(R)`. That
  bridge stays prose; we ASSUME the class is presented by a uniquely-decodable code (`hUD`).
* Sub-normalization only (`≤ 1`, not `= 1`): the paper writes `∝`, so `≤ 1` is exactly what
  well-definedness needs. We do not claim equality (it generally fails — the prior is normalized
  by dividing by the total mass).

## Hypotheses: paper-stated vs added/strengthened
* Paper-stated / faithful: countable class `M`; binary weights `2^{−ℓ}`; the implicit `≤ 1`
  behind `∝`.
* Added/strengthened (scope choices, flagged): (a) binary alphabet `Bool` (faithful to base 2);
  (b) `hUD` — the unique-decodability the paper leaves implicit in "`2^{−K}`", made an explicit
  named hypothesis (this is what makes Kraft apply); (c) `hinj` — distinct hypotheses map to
  distinct codewords (an injective enumeration of `M`); (d) `≤ 1`, not `= 1`.

/-- Paper II §1.1: the Kolmogorov-weighted prior is a sub-probability. For a countable hypothesis
class enumerated without repeats by a uniquely-decodable binary code, the unnormalized weights
`2^{−ℓ(R)}` sum to `≤ 1`, so the prior `w(R') ∝ 2^{−K(R')}` normalizes and the §1.1 Bayesian
mixture is well-defined.

The countable bound follows from the finite one by `Real.tsum_le_of_sum_range_le`: every partial
sum reindexes (injectivity of `code`) onto a finite subset of the code, which is uniquely
decodable by `uniquelyDecodable_of_subset`, hence bounded by `1` via `prior_finset_sum_le_one`. -/
