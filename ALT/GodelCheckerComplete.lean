# A SOUND-AND-COMPLETE bounded proof relation over Foundation ([Decoupling] §6.3)

Provenance: [Decoupling] §6.3 (Theorem 6.3, Level L2b) — the
strengthening flagged there as the "research-grade, non-load-bearing refinement": a
decision morphism that decides bounded `T`-non-provability for *arbitrary* `φ`, not merely the
soundness-only verdict on `G` of `ALT/GodelChecker.lean`.

## Why this is the genuine "decides" (not the sound-only checker)
`ALT/GodelChecker.lean` builds a *concrete Hilbert (ax+MP) checker* and proves it **sound**; its
`Decide(G)=true` then rides on soundness + the imported Gödel unprovability. That is honest but
weak: a sound-only checker cannot certify "no bounded proof EXISTS", only "this checker found none".
The completeness direction was open because Foundation's `⊢` is a **Tait sequent calculus**, with no
Hilbert↔Tait completeness theorem to make an `(ax, mp)` script checker complete.

This file takes the faithful route: it uses Foundation's **own arithmetized proof relation**
`Bootstrapping.Proof T d φ` ("`d` is the Gödel number of a `T`-derivation of `φ`"), which is by
construction the *real* proof relation — hence **sound AND complete** for `T ⊢` (no metatheory to
re-prove):
* SOUND   — `Prf_sound`  : `Bootstrapping.Provable.sound` (`Coding.lean:336`), accept ⇒ `T ⊢ φ`;
* COMPLETE — `Prf_complete`: `internalize_provability` (`D1.lean:24`), `T ⊢ φ` ⇒ accept at some code.

So the decision morphism `Decide T M φ = ⋀_{p ≤ M} ¬Prf(φ,p)` satisfies the GENUINE property
`Decide T M φ = true ↔ no T-proof of φ has Gödel number ≤ M` (`decide_correct`): a *sound and
complete* decision of bounded `T`-provability. `Decide(G)=true` (`paMinus_complete_decides`) is then
a correct verdict whose completeness is real, and a bounded proof would force `Decide = false`
(`decide_false_of_bounded_proof`). This is the precise sense in which Rep(S) **decides** — not
merely soundly approximates — bounded non-provability.

## Decidability / what `noncomputable` means here
Foundation ships **no** `Decidable (Bootstrapping.Proof T d φ)` instance, so `Decide` is packaged classically
(`open Classical`) — it carries only `Classical.choice`, already in the accepted axiom set. This is
not a gap: `Theory.proof` is a `𝚫₁.Semisentence 2` (`Proof/Basic.lean`), i.e. the relation is `Δ₁`
(primitive recursive), so a genuine decision *algorithm* exists; the Lean term simply does not
`#eval`. The morphism's EXISTENCE as a total Boolean function — all Rep(S) needs (§4.1) — is what is
certified.

## The computable-AND-complete decider: a documented WALL
Merging FV-8's *computable* checker (`GodelChecker.Prf`, which `#eval`s but is incomplete) with this
file's *complete* decision (`Decide`, over `Bootstrapping.Proof`, but `noncomputable`) into ONE
computable-and-complete bounded decider is **walled** against the pinned Foundation (rev `b47cf447`,
Lean 4.31). The two probe routes and their precise gaps:

* **(a) reflection over the arithmetized predicate.** `Bootstrapping.Proof T p (⌜φ⌝)` unfolds to
  `DerivationOf`, a **`noncomputable` Δ₁ FIXPOINT** — `Derivation T := (construction T).Fixpoint ![]`
  (`Bootstrapping/Syntax/Proof/Basic.lean:459`) — over coded one-sided-sequent (`𝐋𝐊¹`) derivations
  (`fstIdx`, `^⋏`/`^⋎`/`^∀`/`^∃`, `free`, `setShift`, `substs1`, `IsTerm`, coded-set membership).
  Foundation exposes it ONLY as a `𝚫₁-Relation[V]` (a defining `𝚫₁.Semisentence`); it ships **no**
  `Decidable`/`Primrec`/`Computable`/`Bool` instance. Making `Decide` `#eval` would require a new
  executable `Bool` evaluator for that fixpoint + a proof it agrees with `DerivationOf` — i.e. porting
  Foundation's whole coded-derivation checker to executable Lean.
* **(b) complete computable Hilbert checker.** Extending FV-8's Hilbert (ax+MP) checker to a COMPLETE
  one has **no** Foundation completeness bridge: classical first-order `⊢` is the sequent calculus
  `𝐋𝐊¹` (`FirstOrder/Basic/Calculus.lean`), and Foundation exposes **no** classical Hilbert-vs-`𝐋𝐊¹`
  equivalence (its only first-order Hilbert object, `HilbertProofᵢ` in `Hauptsatz.lean`, is
  *intuitionistic* and internal to cut-elimination). `𝗣𝗔⁻`'s finiteness makes non-logical axiom
  recognition trivially decidable, but leaves the *logical*-completeness bottleneck (a complete FO
  Hilbert calculus + the bridge to `𝐋𝐊¹`) untouched.

Precise missing decidability: `Decidable (Bootstrapping.Proof 𝗣𝗔⁻ p (⌜φ⌝))` over `V = ℕ` (an
executable evaluator for the `DerivationOf` fixpoint). This wall is **non-load-bearing** — the §6.3 verdict
`Decide(G) = true` needs only FV-8's soundness + the imported Gödel unprovability
(`GodelChecker.paMinus_decides_bounded_nonprovability`) — so it closes as a **documented wall +
registered upstream follow-on** (a `Decidable`/`Primrec (Bootstrapping.Proof …)` instance, or an
executable complete derivation checker, in Foundation; upstream-PR targets).

## Witness theory and axioms
`paMinus_complete_decides` at `T★ = 𝗣𝗔⁻` (`PeanoMinus`) — **fully axiom-clean** (`#print axioms` =
`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); `Δ₁` via `Theory.Δ₁.ofFinite`. The parallel `𝗜𝚺₁` witness
`isigma1_complete_decides` (the same statement at `𝗜𝚺₁`) is **also fully axiom-clean**: Foundation's
`𝗜𝚺₁.Δ₁` definability is a *theorem* (`ISigma1_delta1Definable`, discharged upstream), so it carries
no named axiom either. `𝗣𝗔⁻ ⊊ 𝗜𝚺₁`, so the `𝗣𝗔⁻` capstone is the weaker, more faithful (§5.3-class)
statement, and the `𝗜𝚺₁` form is the parallel witness at Foundation's canonical Σ₁-induction theory.

/-! ### Soundness and completeness are load-bearing (not a self-deciding tautology)

`decide_correct` alone is near-definitional (`decide P = true ↔ P`). The two corollaries below make
the *content* explicit — that `Prf = T.Proof` is the genuine, sound *and* complete proof relation:
a **negative** verdict witnesses real `T ⊢ φ` provability (soundness, `provable_of_decide_false`,
uses `Prf_sound`), and `Decide` is **not** trivially always-`true` — every provable sentence is
rejected at a large enough budget (completeness/non-vacuity, `decide_false_of_provable`, uses
`Prf_complete`). So both directions of the proof relation carry weight in the decision. -/

/-- **Soundness is load-bearing.** A *negative* verdict is not merely "the checker failed to find a
proof": by `Prf_sound` it witnesses genuine `T`-provability — if `Decide` rejects `φ` within budget
`M`, some in-budget code is a real `T`-proof, so `T ⊢ φ`. -/

/-- **Completeness is load-bearing (non-vacuity).** `Decide` is not the trivial always-`true`
function: every `T`-provable `φ` is *rejected* at a large enough budget. `Prf_complete` supplies a
proof code `p`, and `decide_false_of_bounded_proof` flips the verdict at `M = p`. -/

  exact ⟨p, decide_false_of_bounded_proof T p φ (le_refl p) hp⟩

/-- Concrete non-vacuity: `⊤` (provable via `verum!`) is decided `false` at some budget, so `Decide`
genuinely distinguishes provable from unprovable sentences. -/
