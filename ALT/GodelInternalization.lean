# Internalizing the bounded proof relation ([Decoupling] §6.3, Theorem 6.3, Levels L2a/L2b)

Provenance: [Decoupling], §4.6 (Proposition 4.5, minimality —
finite products + bounded recursor, no exponential), §5.4 (Proposition 5.4, the necessity
counterpart), §6.1–6.3 (Definition 6.1, Theorem 6.2, Theorem 6.3 the internalization).

This extends the Level-1 Gödel skeleton (`ALT/GodelCore.lean`, `…GodelThreshold.lean`,
`…Reflective.lean`) to the **concrete §6.3 internalization**, machine-checking an explicit capacity
polynomial. Gödel incompleteness stays the imported black box (the `GodelThreshold.Incompleteness`
hypothesis, discharged from Foundation in `ALT/GodelComplete.lean`); we do NOT re-prove it.
By Proposition 4.5 the whole construction lives in the finite-product + bounded-recursor fragment
`Rep₀(S)` — **no Cartesian-closed structure** is used here.

## The quantitative model (the point of this file)
For a Gödel number `g`, write `n := Nat.clog 2 (g+1)` — the bit-length of `g` (the size of the
Gödel sentence, §5.3). Two budgets enter (Definition 6.1), kept apart:
* `M_idx ≥ g` indexes the sentence (Level 1);
* `M_chk ≥ poly(g)` is the value range of proof codes the checker enumerates (the larger budget).

Capacities are **bit-lengths**: hosting depth `M_chk` costs working memory `|s_work| ≥ log₂ M_chk`.
The explicit capacity polynomial is `capacity n := 2 * n` (§6.3: `|s_work| = poly(n)`): with
`M_chk ≤ g^2` (a concrete `poly(g)`) we prove `M_chk + 1 ≤ 2 ^ (capacity n)` by `Nat`/`omega`
reasoning, and tie the necessity direction to the sharp pigeonhole `depth_succ_le_two_pow` of D1.
The bounded search ranges over `ProofCode M_chk := {p // p ≤ M_chk}` (a `Fintype`) and is the finite
fold along the orbit of the bounded recursor `cyclicParamNNO M_chk` of D1 — no exponential.

## What this DOES establish (the abstract conditional — axiom-clean)
* `BoundedChecker`: the abstract §6.3 interface — a `Formula` type, a decidable bounded proof
  relation `Prf : Formula → ℕ → Bool`, the size map `gnum`, a recursion budget `Mchk`, and the
  **soundness** field `Prf φ p = true → Derivable φ` (accepts ⇒ derivable — one direction).
* `Decide`/`decide_eq_true_iff`: the L2b decision morphism `Decide φ = ⋀_{p ≤ M_chk} ¬Prf(φ,p)` is
  total (a `Fintype` fold) and `Decide φ = true ↔ ∀ p ≤ M_chk, ¬Prf(φ,p)`.
* `decide_eq_true_iff_orbit`: the same fold expressed along the **recursor orbit** of
  `cyclicParamNNO M_chk` (`ProofCode` enumerated by the D1 orbit, valued by `ZMod.val`).
* `decide_godel` (the L2b ∧ L3 capstone): from `GodelThreshold.Incompleteness` (imported Gödel) and
  the soundness field, `Decide(G_{T_S}) = true` — Rep(S) decides bounded non-provability.
* `capacity_bound`: explicit `M_chk + 1 ≤ 2 ^ (capacity n)` for `M_chk ≤ g^2` (capacity polynomial).
* `proofCodes_embed`: `ProofCode M_chk ↪ S_work` once `M_chk + 1 ≤ 2^{|s_work|}` (i.e. `ProofCode
  ⊆ S_work`).
* `prop_5_4` (Proposition 5.4, necessity): a recursor on `W` with `|W| = 2^{|s_work|}` indexing `g`
  forces `|s_work| ≥ Nat.clog 2 (g+1)` — the two-sided threshold's lower edge, from D1's pigeonhole.
* `internalization` (Theorem 6.3, L1 ∧ L2b ∧ capacity bundled): the concrete §6.3 statement.

## What this does NOT establish (flagged)
* NOT Gödel incompleteness — imported (`GodelThreshold.Incompleteness`); discharged in
  `ALT/GodelComplete.lean`. NOT the exponential / Cartesian closure (Proposition 4.5: unused).
* `Formula` is kept abstract (the L2a *carving* of `Formula := {c ≤ M_chk ∧ Wff c}` as a subobject
  of `S_work` is a modeling choice deferred to the concrete witness); `gnum`/`Derivable` abstract.
* The concrete discharge of the `BoundedChecker` interface lives on the Foundation side
  (`ALT/GodelChecker.lean`, `paMinus_decides_bounded_nonprovability` — the axiom-clean `𝗣𝗔⁻`
  capstone; the earlier `𝗜𝚺₁` witnesses are retired): it cannot share this file
  because Foundation's root `Matrix.map` collides with umbrella-Mathlib's (the same Mathlib/Foundation
  import divide that keeps the Foundation-side files separate).

## Hypotheses: paper-stated vs added
* Paper-stated / faithful: the §6.3 `Prf`/`Decide` construction; Proposition 5.4; the two budgets;
  the capacity polynomial `poly(n)`; soundness (accepts ⇒ derivable).
* Added / modeling: `Formula`/`gnum`/`Derivable` abstract; the concrete `poly(g) := g^2` witness for
  `M_chk`; `capacity n := 2*n`; the recursor on `ZMod (M_chk+1)` (D1's `cyclicParamNNO`).

size map `gnum`, an internal `Derivable` predicate, a recursion budget `Mchk`, and a **decidable**
bounded proof relation `Prf φ p` ("`p` is a proof of `φ`," codes `p ≤ Mchk`) that is **sound** —
accepting a code implies derivability (one direction; the only direction §6.3 L2b needs). -/

is the precise §6.3 sense in which the bounded search is "a single finite fold along the orbit of
the bounded recursor `N_{M_chk}`". -/

/-- §6.3 L2b ∧ L3 (the capstone): from the imported Gödel fact `GodelThreshold.Incompleteness` (a
representable sentence `G`, true and **not derivable**) and the checker's soundness, the decision
morphism returns `true` on `G`: Rep(S) **decides bounded non-provability** of `G_{T_S}`. The step
from "no bounded proof" (decided here) to "no proof of any length" is L3, the imported theorem —
used only as the hypothesis `¬ Derivable G`. -/

/-- The explicit §6.3 capacity polynomial `P(n) = 2n` (work-memory bit-count): for the concrete
proof-code budget `M_chk ≤ g^2` it hosts the recursor of depth `M_chk` (`M_chk + 1 ≤ 2^{P(n)}`). -/
def capacity (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 * n

/-- Explicit capacity bound (Theorem 6.2 / §6.3): with `M_chk ≤ g^2` (a concrete `poly(g)`), the
recursor depth `M_chk` is hosted by `capacity n = 2n` work bits, `n := Nat.clog 2 (g+1)` the size of
the Gödel sentence: `M_chk + 1 ≤ 2 ^ (capacity n)`. Pure `Nat`/`omega` reasoning. -/
theorem capacity_bound (g Mchk : ℕ) (hM : Mchk ≤ g ^ 2) :
    Mchk + 1 ≤ 2 ^ capacity (Nat.clog 2 (g + 1)) := by
  set n := Nat.clog 2 (g + 1) with hn
  have hg : g + 1 ≤ 2 ^ n := Nat.le_pow_clog (by norm_num) _

    _ ≤ (2 ^ n) ^ 2 := by nlinarith [hg, Nat.zero_le g]
    _ = 2 ^ capacity n := hpow.symm

/-- §5.4 / §6.3 — the per-proof **verification workspace** is within the linear capacity `2n`. Every
candidate proof code `p ≤ M_chk` (hence the workspace to *hold* one candidate proof, the part that
was previously flagged "not yet bounded") fits in `capacity n = 2n` work bits, `n := Nat.clog 2
(g+1)`, given the concrete budget `M_chk ≤ g^2`. So the per-proof workspace is `poly(n)` — indeed
within the *same* `2n` as the syntax objects and the recursor — and the two-sidedness of Proposition
5.4 is tight up to a constant, not open at the verification step. (The remaining `Δ₀`/poly-time check
of a held candidate, Buss 1986, runs in `poly(n)` scratch — paper-level.) The *assembly* of these
per-constituent bounds into the scratch bound of the enumeration itself is machine-checked in
`CheckerScratch.checker_scratch_closure` — the loop over all `M_chk + 1` candidates runs in a
workspace bounded independently of `M_chk` — with the per-candidate check entering there as its
`hstep` hypothesis, exactly the paper-level input named above. -/

enough to host the recursor depth `M_chk` (`M_chk + 1 ≤ 2^{|s_work|}`), the proof codes embed into
it. `Fintype.card (ProofCode M_chk) = M_chk + 1 ≤ |W|`. -/
