# Rep(S) "up to capacity": the finite full subcategory and the honest non-closure (FV-14)

Provenance: `01_decoupling_and_categorical_threshold.md` §4.2–§4.3 — Rep(S) is "a full subcategory of
finite sets, **Cartesian closed up to capacity**", presented as the capacity filtration
`Rep(S) = colim_d Rep(S)_{≤d}`; global closure *fails* because the exponential `[T₁ ⇒ T₂]` has
`|T₂|^{|T₁|}` elements, overflowing `2^{|s_work|}`.

This file makes "up to capacity" precise on the genuine realizability CCC `Asm` (FV-12/FV-13):
* `FitsIn A s` — the capacity predicate (carrier finite, `≤ 2^s` elements: ⊆ `{0,1}^s`);
* `RepS s` — **Rep(S) as the finite full subcategory** of `Asm` of objects that fit;
* `recursorAsm_fitsIn` — the §5 bounded recursor fits (`M+1 ≤ 2^s`), tying to `prop_5_4`/the `2n`
  capacity on the unified carrier (FV-13);
* `prodAsm_fitsIn` — **products stay in the filtration** (`|A×B| = |A|·|B|`, fits in `sₐ+s_b`);
* `exp_card_overflow` — **global closure FAILS on cardinality grounds**: a fitting object whose
  function-space exponential `|α→α| = |α|^{|α|}` overflows `2^s`.

## Honest residual (NOT closed here)
The *cardinality* side of "global closure fails" is machine-checked below. The **realizer-length**
side of §4.3 (a generic exponential element needs a realizer of length `~2^{|s_work|}`, by the
Shannon/Li–Vitányi counting bound) rests on a **categorical treatment of Kolmogorov complexity**,
which does not exist (the paper records this as an open *method*; cf. `KolmogorovComplexity.lean` for
the non-categorical counting infrastructure). So FV-14 earns the element-count non-closure, not the
realizer-length non-closure.

/-- §4.1/§4.3 — the **capacity predicate** on the realizability CCC `Asm` ("up to capacity"): the

into `s` work bits exactly when `M + 1 ≤ 2^s` — the FV-8 capacity arithmetic (`prop_5_4`), now on the
unified `Asm` carrier (FV-13). At the degree-2 budget this is the linear `2n` capacity. -/

/-- §4.3 — **global Cartesian closure FAILS on capacity (cardinality) grounds.** For every capacity
`s ≥ 1` there is a fitting object `α` (`|α| = 2^s ≤ 2^s`) whose exponential — the function space
`α → α`, with `|α → α| = |α|^{|α|} = (2^s)^{2^s}` (§4.3's `|T₂|^{|T₁|}`) — **overflows** `2^s`. So no
fixed work memory is closed under the exponential, even though each exponential remains a perfectly
good finite set. (This `α → α` is exactly §4.3's function-space exponential `|T₂|^{|T₁|}`. For finite
assemblies every function is trackable, so the realizability exponential `expAsm α α` has the *same*
carrier `α → α` and overflows identically — that coincidence is true but not separately formalized
here, so we state the non-closure about the function space, the §4.3 quantity.) -/
