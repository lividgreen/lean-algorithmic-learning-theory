# Pressure window Π: break-even (B1a) + interval structure (B1b)

Provenance: the conjectural pressure-window framing ("usefulness and retention are the same
ratio", target **B1a**) and its ratio form ("the pressure ratio `Π = L_struct / K_avail`" and its
two-sided window, target **B1b**). B1a: the rule is worth retaining exactly when the selective
payoff of the MDL dominance
gap exceeds the Landauer upkeep, iff the observation length exceeds an explicit break-even
threshold `(L − r) · v > p_err · |s_code| · kT · ln 2`. B1b: the localized regime band is an
explicit interval in the pressure ratio `Π`, naming its edges `Π_low`, `Π_high`.

Builds conceptually on the existing cores `ALT/MDLDominance.lean` (FV-4: the dominance gap
`(L − r) − O(log L)`, the *usefulness* side) and `ALT/RetentionOverhead.lean` (FV-6: the
conditional-regeneration capacity overhead). Those are inspected and cross-referenced but NOT
imported: `upkeep` here is a Landauer maintenance *flux* (energy), a different quantity from
`RetentionOverhead.g` (capacity *bits*), and `payoff` parameterizes the leading dominance gap
abstractly, so a clean reuse is not available — B1a is kept self-contained.

Status: PROVED as pure real-arithmetic (a break-even iff, B1a; an interval iff, B1b; the dynamical
scissors under two POSITED monotonicities, S2).

## What this DOES establish
* `breakeven` (B1a): with positive per-prediction value `v`, retaining the rule pays
  (`upkeep < payoff`) iff the observation length `L` exceeds the explicit threshold
  `L_be = r + upkeep / v`.
* `netBenefit_pos` (B1a): the same fact in the `0 < netBenefit` form that §1.3 states
  (`netBenefit > 0 ↔ L_be < L`).
* `regimeBand_iff_pi_mem` (B1b): with positive capacity, the localized regime band holds iff the
  pressure `Π = L_struct / K_avail` lies in the interval `[Π_low, Π_high]` — making the two-sided
  pressure window well-defined as an interval and naming its edges. Plus `pi_pos` (positivity) and
  `Pi_mono_left` (`Π` increasing in the structured flux).
* `pi_antitone` (S2): under the two POSITED monotonicities `AccessDegrading L_struct` (structured
  flux ↓) and `CapacityConcentrating K_avail` (capacity ↑, positive), the pressure
  `Π(t) = L_struct t / K_avail t` is antitone in time (the §1.2 "scissors").
* `window_is_interval` + `dynamical_window` (S2): for any antitone `Π`, the window is a TIME
  interval — `Π` sweeps down through it (in at `Π_high`, out at `Π_low`); the capstone phrases this
  via B1b's `RegimeBand`.

## What this does NOT establish (flagged)
* This is the arithmetic core / break-even *threshold*, NOT the full retention theorem; the Cheng
  (2026) Context-Channel-Capacity / conditional-regeneration argument stays in prose.
* `payoff` uses the LEADING gap `(L − r)`. The exact dominance gap (with the `−O(log L)` correction)
  is `MDLDominance.dominance_gap_eq`; a tighter break-even via that correction is an optional
  refinement, NOT claimed here.
* The numerator is [Discovery]'s `L` (the proved dominance gap). the framing's `L_struct`
  (epiplexity flux) is the conjectural pressure-window numerator; replacing `L` by `L_struct` is the
  CONJECTURAL step and is NOT done here.
* `v`, `p_err`, `kT` are modeled real parameters; `kT · ln 2` is the physical Landauer input (cited,
  not derived). The break-even algebra is sign-agnostic — it needs only `0 < v`; the physical regime
  `p_err, kT ≥ 0` (which makes `upkeep ≥ 0`) is not required and is not assumed.
* (B1b) `regimeBand_iff_pi_mem` is a REPARAMETRIZATION only — thin by design (cf.
  `PolyTimeAccounting`). It rewrites the band conditions in the `Π` variable and names the edges; it
  does NOT derive `Π_low` / `Π_high`. `Π_high` in particular is not derived from any throughput /
  access model — that is the conjectural access-degradation operator `S2`, the anticipated
  expressivity wall (documented): S2 below formalizes only the DOWNSTREAM
  consequence of `S2`, taking its monotonicity as a posited hypothesis.
* (B1b) `L_struct` is the conjectural epiplexity flux (§1.1 / §3.3) — NOT raw entropy, and NOT Paper
  II's proved `L`. The whole `Π` object is conjectural framing; this lemma establishes only its
  interval structure. No causal content ("firehose swamps / trickle insufficient ⇒ no
  representational reflection") is proved — only the interval algebra. (In prose the lower edge
  relates to the B1a break-even `L_be`, the "worth compressing" threshold, but the precise
  identification of
  `L_struct` with `L` is conjectural and is NOT formalized.)
* (S2) The two monotonicities `AccessDegrading L_struct` and `CapacityConcentrating K_avail` are
  POSITED, NOT derived. Deriving `AccessDegrading` (local `S_T`/`L_struct` ↓ under expansion) from
  conservation + expansion is the EXPRESSIVITY WALL: no existing theorem links local
  bounded-observer epiplexity dynamics to global conservation/expansion (the entropy-density,
  `E[K]=H`, DPI, and ergodic-mixing routes all require building the missing bridge). `t` is an
  abstract time parameter; "expansion" is modeled ONLY as these two monotonicities.
* (S2) This proves the scissors logic only — monotone inputs ⟹ `Π` antitone ⟹ the window is a time
  interval. It makes NO claim that any physical system's `L_struct`/`K_avail` are actually monotone
  (Layer-2), NO rate claim, and NO non-emptiness claim (whether `t₁ ≤ t₂`, i.e. whether the window
  is actually entered, depends on quantitative inputs we do not have). No causal content about
  representational reflection — only the dynamical interval algebra.

## Hypotheses: paper-stated vs added
* Paper-stated / faithful: the §1.3 break-even inequality `(L − r) · v > upkeep`; the Landauer
  upkeep form `p_err · |s_code| · kT · ln 2`; the §1.1 ratio `Π = L_struct / K_avail`.
* Added / modeling: `L`, `r`, `v`, `p_err`, `scode`, `kT`, `L_struct`, `K_avail`, `Π_low`, `Π_high`
  are abstract reals; B1a needs only `0 < v`, B1b only `0 < K_avail`.
* POSITED (S2, the wall): `AccessDegrading L_struct` (`L_struct` antitone + nonneg) and
  `CapacityConcentrating K_avail` (`K_avail` monotone + positive) — assumptions about the time
  dynamics, not derived (see the does-NOT block).

`Real.log` is the natural logarithm; `Real.log 2 = ln 2` is the Landauer constant.
