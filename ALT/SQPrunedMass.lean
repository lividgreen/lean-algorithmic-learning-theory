# Post-discovery pruned mass: competitor-decay + Kraft (Paper III Appendix A, Claim 2)

Provenance: Paper III, Appendix A "Soundness of SQ pruning", Claim 2
(the accumulated pruned mass is `≤ δ/2`).  This file supplies the **post-discovery half** of that
claim: once the search has run past `T_discover`, the total posterior mass ever assigned to pruned
competitors is `≤ δ/2`, established by competitor decay + the Kraft inequality **alone** — with *no*
maximal inequality (Doob/Ville), which is the part the prose defers to a martingale tail bound.

This is the companion to `ALT/SQVersionSpace.lean` (FV-A4, "truth survives pruning") and
`ALT/SQOracle.lean` (FV-E, the empirical-answer concentration): there the geometry of a *single*
pruning step is proved; here the *accumulated* mass across the whole pruned set is summed & bounded.

Like `ALT/SampleComplexity.lean` (FV-B2) this file reuses Paper II as **imported hypotheses**
rather than re-deriving it: the per-competitor posterior bound
`wt i ≤ w i · 2^K · exp(−2tε₀)` is taken as the hypothesis `hdecay`, which bundles two cited facts —
the likelihood decay `L_t(R') ≤ exp(−2tε₀)` (Paper II `DeterministicDiscovery`) and the
normaliser lower bound `Z_t ≥ w(R) = 2^{−K}`.  The NEW content proved here is exactly the two steps
the paper leaves implicit:

* `prefactor_le`: killing the `2^K` prefactor past `T_discover` — for
  `t ≥ (K·log 2 + log(2/δ))/(2ε₀)`, geometric decay drives `2^K · exp(−2tε₀) ≤ δ/2`.
* `accumulated_pruned_mass_le`: the Kraft sum — the prefactor bound is *uniform in `t`* across the
  pruned set, so summing the per-competitor decay over `pruned` with Kraft `∑ w ≤ 1` gives
  `∑ wt ≤ δ/2`.

Notational note: `2^K` is written `Real.exp (K * Real.log 2)` throughout, so that `K : ℝ` (the
description length in nats-vs-bits is absorbed into `K`) and the algebra stays inside the
`Real.exp`/`Real.log` API.

## What this DOES establish
* The post-discovery accumulated pruned mass is `≤ δ/2`, from `hdecay` (decay × normaliser) and
  `hkraft` (`∑ w ≤ 1`) — i.e. Appendix A Claim 2's second half, with no maximal inequality.

## What this does NOT establish (stays in prose; no overclaiming)
* Not the pre-discovery half of Claim 2 (the transient `t < T_discover` mass), which is the
  martingale / maximal-inequality argument the paper cites — this file is explicitly the
  *post-`T_discover`* contribution.
* Not the decay `L_t(R') ≤ exp(−2tε₀)` nor the normaliser `Z_t ≥ 2^{−K}`: those are the Paper II
  `DeterministicDiscovery` facts, imported here pre-bundled as the single hypothesis `hdecay`.
* Not the union with `ALT/SQOracle.lean`'s `1−δ` truth-survival into a single `1−δ` soundness
  statement: that final assembly stays in prose (it is the Bayes-mixture argument of Paper II).
