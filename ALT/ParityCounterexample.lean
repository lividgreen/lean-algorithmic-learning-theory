# Parity counterexample to Assumption A (Paper III, §5)

Provenance: `03_polynomial_convergence_under_SQ.md`, §3.4 (statistical dimension + Assumption A),
§4 (Theorem 4.1, which assumes `d_SQ = poly(r)`), and §5 ("What about Parity?"). The mathematical
content is the elementary "exponential beats every polynomial".

Status: PROVED as pure real-asymptotics statements. This is the *arithmetic core* of §5 only.

## What this DOES establish
* `poly_isLittleO_dSQ`: every (real) power of `r` is little-o of the modeled exponential
  statistical dimension `dSQ ε` — the "exp beats poly" fact, in Mathlib asymptotics.
* `dSQ_not_polyBounded`: the modeled `d_SQ` admits NO polynomial bound. Hence **Assumption A**
  (`d_SQ = poly(r)`, §3.4/§4) **fails** for parity, so **Theorem 4.1 does not apply** to it —
  the §5 "theorem operating within its correct scope" point, formalized.

## What this does NOT establish (stays in prose; no overclaiming)
* Not the SQ statistical dimension `d_SQ` itself: no SQ oracle, no concept class, no query
  machinery. `dSQ ε` is a bare exponential standing in for it.
* Not the identification `r ≈ n`, and not that parity's `d_SQ` really *is* `2^Ω(n)` (the
  Blum–Furst–Jackson–Kearns–Mansour–Rudich fact). We take "`d_SQ` is exponential in `r`" as the
  MODELED PREMISE.
* Not Raz's `Ω(r²)` memory lower bound, not that it violates Paper II's C1, and not that
  `g(r,δ) = O(r·log(r/δ))` is "false for parity" — those §5 consequences stay in prose.
* We prove ONLY the arithmetic: exponential ⇏ polynomial, hence Assumption A fails.

## Hypotheses: paper-stated vs added/strengthened
* Paper-stated / faithful: Assumption A as a polynomial bound (`∃ C, k`); the regime `r → ∞`
  (`Filter.atTop`).
* Added/strengthened (flagged): modeling `2^Ω(n)` as `Real.exp (ε·r)` with a CONCRETE `ε > 0`
  and an EXACT exponent in place of `Ω(·)`. Since `2^{c·r} = exp((c·ln 2)·r)`, base-`e` with a
  positive `ε` is fully general (the base is absorbed into `ε`); this is precisely the exponential
  lower bound on `d_SQ` the paper asserts, made concrete.

`d_SQ ≤ 0` somewhere in `atTop`, contradicting `Real.exp_pos`. -/
