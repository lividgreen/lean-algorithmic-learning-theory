# Regime consistency ([Discovery], §1.2)

Provenance: [Discovery], §1.2 (the regime constants C1–C3). The regime
`r ≪ K ≪ L` is load-bearing in [Discovery], [SQ], and [Inevitability]; this file certifies it is
internally consistent in the ordering sense.

Status: PROVED as pure real-arithmetic statements. This is the *arithmetic core* of the §1.2
regime only.

## What this DOES establish
* `regime_strict_ordering`: under C1 (`K ≥ c₀·r·log(r/δ)`), C2 (`L ≥ c₁·K`), C3 (`r ≥ c₂`) and
  explicit NAMED constant conditions, the strict ordering `r < K ∧ K < L` holds. This underwrites
  every II–IV result that assumes the regime `r ≪ K ≪ L`.
* `regime_satisfiable`: the premise set of `regime_strict_ordering` is satisfiable — concrete
  values (`r=3, δ=1/2, c₀=1, c₁=2, c₂=3, K=100, L=200`) meet C1–C3 and all constant conditions.
  Together with the implication this shows the regime is genuinely *non-empty* (not vacuously
  certified): the constraints are consistent AND force `r < K < L`.

## What this does NOT establish (stays in prose; no overclaiming)
* No Kolmogorov complexity: `r`, `K`, `L`, `δ` are abstract reals; `r` is not `K(R)`, `K` is not a
  machine-relative memory in bits.
* Proves only the arithmetic ordering — NOT that any physical system realizes constants satisfying
  C1–C3 (§1.2's "we assume there exist…" is an empirical input, untouched).
* Renders the paper's "≪" as strict `<` with a concrete constant gap (`c₁>1`, `c₀≥1`), a
  *sufficient concrete instance*, not §1.2's asymptotic "`K,L,r→∞` with ratios fixed" limit.
* Does not claim joint satisfiability with the other II–IV conditions (e.g. `L = n·log|O|`, `n≥2`)
  — only the C1–C3 ordering.

## Hypotheses: paper-stated vs added/strengthened
* Paper-stated / faithful: C1, C2, C3 verbatim; `δ ∈ (0,1)`.
* Strengthened (flagged):
  - `c₁ > 1` is load-bearing: bare `c₁ > 0` with C2's `≥` permits `L = K`, so strict `K < L`
    genuinely needs `c₁ > 1`. This is the concrete-instance form of the regularity "≪".
  - `c₀ ≥ 1` (paper: `c₀ > 0`): with bare `c₀ > 0` the strict `r < K` holds only asymptotically;
    `c₀ ≥ 1` with `log(r/δ) > 1` gives it non-asymptotically.
  - `c₂ ≥ 3` (paper: `c₂ > 0`, practically `≈10³`): the minimal value forcing `log(r/δ) > 1`,
    far below the paper's buffer, so no real restriction.

`Real.log` is the natural logarithm, as in the companion files.

namespace RegimeConsistency

/-- The regime `r ≪ K ≪ L` is internally consistent: under C1–C3 with explicit named constant
conditions, the strict ordering `r < K < L` holds. The two estimates are independent — `r < K`
from C1 (`c₀·r·log(r/δ) > r`, since `c₀ ≥ 1` and `log(r/δ) > 1`) and `K < L` from C2
(`c₁·K > K`, since `c₁ > 1` and `K > 0`). ([Discovery] §1.2.) -/

/-- The premises of `regime_strict_ordering` are satisfiable: `r=3, δ=1/2, c₀=1, c₁=2, c₂=3,
K=100, L=200` meet C1–C3 and all constant conditions. The C1 check uses only the crude bound
`log 6 ≤ 5` (`Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos`), so `c₀·r·log(r/δ) = 3·log 6 ≤ 15 ≤ 100 = K`. This
makes the regime genuinely non-empty, so the implication is not vacuous. -/
