# Search-phase pruned mass: the log-Bayes potential (Paper III Appendix A, Claim 2, search half)

Provenance: `03_polynomial_convergence_under_SQ.md`, Appendix A "Soundness of SQ pruning", Claim 2,
the **search-phase** (`t < T_discover`) residual gap. Companion to
`ALT/SQPrunedMass.lean` (FV-F), which handles only the post-discovery half.

The prose flags the search phase open because the per-competitor bound
`w_t(R') ≤ w(R')·2^{K(R)}·exp(−2tε₀)` keeps an un-killed `2^{K(R)}` prefactor there. The resolution
is a **log-Bayes potential** the naive bound ignores: with
`Φ_t := −ln w_t(R)` (truth's normalized-posterior potential, in nats), `Φ_0 ≤ ln2·K(R)` (Kraft) and
`Φ_t ≥ 0`; a renormalization-prune of a competitor with normalized mass `m` drops `Φ` by
`−ln(1 − m) ≥ m`. Summing, the accumulated pruned mass is `≤ Φ_0 ≤ ln2·K(R) = O(r)` — the RIGHT
order (discovery regret), not `δ/2`.

`C` below is the potential range in nats, `= ln2·K(R) = O(r)`.

## What this DOES establish
* `search_phase_pruned_mass_le`: given the per-prune charge to a bounded potential `Φ` on `[0,K]`
  (hypotheses `hΦ0`, `hΦn`, `hcharge`), the accumulated pruned mass `∑ m i ≤ K`. The NEW elementary
  content is the pointwise `m ≤ −ln(1 − m)` (mass ≤ its log-drop) summed over the pruned set, then
  charged to the potential's total decrease.
* `potential_range`: the telescoping `∑ (Φ k − Φ (k+1)) = Φ 0 − Φ n ≤ K` for a potential with
  `Φ 0 ≤ K`, `Φ n ≥ 0` — the "potential lies in `[0,K]`" half, elementary.
* `pruned_mass_le_budget`: the slack form — the per-prune charge may exceed the telescoped
  potential drop by an additive budget `B` (the between-pruning Bayesian-update net rise); the mass
  bound degrades to `C + B`. This is the deterministic core the Ville chain rests on, with
  `B = ln(1/δ)`.
* `search_phase_mass_ville_chain`: the chained probabilistic capstone. With `Z_t` a non-negative
  supermartingale (`𝔼[Z_0] ≤ 1`; realizable likelihood-ratio mixture) and the per-path charge
  valid on the no-excursion event `{∀ t, Z_t < 1/δ}`, the accumulated pruned mass exceeds
  `C + ln(1/δ)` only on the Ville excursion event, so `μ{mass > C + ln(1/δ)} ≤ δ` — the paper's
  `O(r + log(1/δ))` w.h.p. bound. The `ln(1/δ)` term is DERIVED from `Ville.ville_potential_budget`,
  not assumed: the two cores (log-Bayes potential drop and Ville excursion control) are now
  formally chained.

## What this does NOT establish (stays modeled / imported; no overclaiming)
The two cores ARE now chained (`search_phase_mass_ville_chain`); the `ln(1/δ)` excursion term is
derived from the proved `Ville.ville_potential_budget` (`ALT/Ville.lean`): for a non-negative
supermartingale `Z_t` with `𝔼[Z_0] ≤ 1`, `μ{∃ t, 1/δ ≤ Z_t} ≤ δ` (Ville at `λ = 1/δ`). What stays
modeled shrinks to:
* (i) the **supermartingale premise** on `Z_t`: that `Z_t = ∑ w(R')·L_t(R')` is a non-negative
  supermartingale with `𝔼[Z_0] ≤ 1` (realizability) — passed as `hsuper`,
  `hnn`, `hZ0`.
* (ii) the **Kraft bound** `Φ_0 ≤ ln2·K(R)` (from `∑ w ≤ 1`, a Paper II fact) and the identification
  `C = ln2·K(R)` — supplied numerically by the caller (`hΦ0`).
* (iii) the **conditional per-path charge** `hcharge` (per-prune log-drop `+` the Bayes-update net
  rise `≤ ln(1/δ)`, VALID ON the no-excursion event `{∀ t, Z_t < 1/δ}`) and the predictive-transfer
  semantics ("`O(r)` pruned mass is absorbed into the `O(r)` regret", the Bayes-mixture argument of
  Paper II).
