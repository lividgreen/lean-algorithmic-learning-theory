# The explicit ε₀ lower bound (Paper II §3.3 / Theorem 3.1, target F5)

Provenance: `02_mdl_dominance_and_discovery.md`, §3.3 / Theorem 3.1. `ε₀` is the minimum
squared-Hellinger separation between the true rule `R` and any competitor in the model class; it
sits in `T_discover = O(r · log(1/δ) / ε₀²)` and is inherited by Paper III.

There is NO universal lower bound on `ε₀` — parity-type classes drive it to zero (that is
`ALT/ParityCounterexample.lean` / FV-A3). So F5 does not bound `ε₀` in general; it DEMOTES `ε₀`
from a factor hidden in the big-O to an explicit, named class parameter: `ε₀` as a minimum over the
class, its strict positivity, an explicit lower bound for "well-separated" classes, and the
resulting conditional polynomial discovery bound.

Status: PROVED as pure `Finset` / real arithmetic. A thin supporting win (cf. `PolyTimeAccounting`).

## What this DOES establish
* `eps0 := M.inf' hM sep`: `ε₀` as the least separation over a finite nonempty model class.
* `eps0_pos`: `ε₀ > 0` when every competitor is strictly separated from `R` (realizability +
  distinctness).
* `eps0_ge_of_separated`: for a `γ`-separated class, the explicit lower bound `ε₀ ≥ γ` — the
  demotion of `ε₀` to a named class parameter. Plus `eps0_le_sep` (`ε₀ ≤ sep i` per competitor `i`).
* `Tdiscover` + `Tdiscover_le_of_separated`: discovery time as an EXPLICIT function of `ε₀` (the
  `1/ε₀²` in the open, not hidden in the big-O), bounded by its value at the floor `γ` for a
  `γ`-separated class — polynomial in `r` when `γ = Ω(1/poly r)`. Plus `Tdiscover_antitone`.

## What this does NOT establish (flagged)
* NO universal `ε₀` lower bound is claimed — none exists; parity-type classes drive `ε₀ → 0`
  (`ALT/ParityCounterexample.lean` / FV-A3). This file only demotes `ε₀` to an explicit class
  parameter `γ` and gives the CONDITIONAL bound.
* `sep : ι → ℝ` abstractly models the squared-Hellinger separation `d_H²(P_R, P_{R_i})` as a real
  per competitor; the measure-theoretic Hellinger distance is NOT constructed here (deferred — would
  need probability machinery).
* Ties to Paper II Theorem 3.1 by making the `ε₀`-dependence explicit; the constant `c` and the
  discovery / concentration analysis itself (Grünwald–Mehta) stay IMPORTED (the FV-7 / §3 boundary),
  not re-proved.
* Pure arithmetic / reparametrization-level; no new learning-theory content.

## Hypotheses: paper-stated vs added
* Paper-stated / faithful: `ε₀` as the min separation; `T_discover ∝ 1/ε₀²` (Thm 3.1); the
  separated-class regime.
* Added / modeling: `M : Finset ι` (finite class), `sep : ι → ℝ` (abstract separation); the
  `γ`-separation floor and nonnegativity hypotheses are named, not derived.
